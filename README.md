### Creating a Sub Theme

This Yeoman generator allows you to create a sub-theme of any Drupal base theme. When you initiate the generator, it will ask you which Drupal base theme you would like to use. There are several packed with this, some of which will give you their own special code when you create a sub-theme. You can also specify any other base theme of your choice, by selecting "custom".

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
